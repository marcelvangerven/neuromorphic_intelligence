## Neuromorphic Intelligence

Codebase for replicating the experiments in https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11940. This version now includes multiple experimental runs as in the followup journal paper.

notebooks/noise_based_learning.ipynb replicates learning experiments
notebooks/differential_genetic_programming.ipynb replicates genetic programming experiments

To install this codebase, run the install.sh script (requires uv to be installed: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
